- 	👋 	Hi, I’m @A2Misbehave
- 	👀 	I’m interested in building useful software, some Open Source and some to sustain a living.
- 	🌱 	I’m currently learning Python.
- 	💞️ 	I’m not exactly looking to collaborate. If there ever is a project that hits me right, then I might consider it. But as of now, I'm too damn autistic for that. I'd much prefer to see how far I can get solo. Doesn't mean I won't be open to learning from others or 				taking into account something someone might point out about my open source project, especially within issues since I will not be accepting pull requests on anything. Apologies.
- 	📫 	How to reach me: @A2Misbehave on X. Or something. Eventually I may build a form somewhere for direct contact. For now, there is only a text based website and a single social media channel.
- 	⚡ 	Fun fact: No.
