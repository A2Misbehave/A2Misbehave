- 👋 Hi, I’m @A2Misbehave
- 👀 I’m interested in building useful software, some Open Source and some to sustain a living.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on unknown. I don't know what is out there. But I'm learning. There will be something I will eventually want to contribute towards or collaborate with.
- 📫 How to reach me @A2Misbehave on X. Or something. Eventually I may build a form somewhere for direct contact. For now, there is only a text based website and a single social media channel.
- ⚡ Fun fact: No.
